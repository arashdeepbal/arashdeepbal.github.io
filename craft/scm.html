			<h1>Building "Supply Chain" tech for OYO</h1>
			<p>One of the key differentiators for OYO which sets it apart from other hospitality companies is the transformation process. Every hotel property before coming on the OYO platform undergoes transformation to ensure that it meets OYO standards. This Transformation process requires a number of items (such as air conditioners, TVs, linen, bed sheet etc.) to be ordered for each property. The aim of this project is to improve the ordering process, gain efficiencies, reduce errors and increase visibility across the various stages of the order fulfillment process.</p>

To comply with my non-disclosure agreement, I have omitted and obfuscated confidential information in this case study. The information in this case study is my own and does not necessarily reflect the views of OYO Rooms/Oravel Stays Pvt Ltd.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="insertmargin48"></div>
			<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
			<p>Currently, the orders passed from transformation to vendor management are received from diverse avenues ranging from third-party solutions to emails and google sheets. Further, the processes involved in the purchase to pay cycle are executed on different platforms. This leads to limited visibility to stakeholders, inefficiencies, and reiterations in the fulfillment process.</p>
			<div class="insertmargin48"></div>
			<h3>Users</h3>
			<p><b>Transformation Team</b> <br>The TR team are the buyers who will place Orders on the portal for their properties. Ground TR will have the permissions to place Orders on the Portal. They would also be able to Track and acknowledge the goods received.</p>
			<p><b>Supply Chain Management Team</b> <br>The SCM team is responsible for fulfilling the Orders. They are the ones who on receiving the order, will assign and coordinate with the Vendors, coordinate with the finance team and get payments released for Vendors once the Order is fulfilled.</p>
			<p><b>PR/PO(Purchase Request/Purchase Order)team</b> <br>They will filter the orders which are in PR Requested status, and then later upload PO.</p>
			<div class="insertmargin48"></div>
			<h3>Defining the process</h3>
			<p>Before defining the product, it was essential to put down a process that would be followed in the coming future. A lot of time went into discussions of how we envisioned the product and its adaptability into the current system. The initial discussions focused on how purchase orders were sent and fulfilled adhering to the legal obligations as well. <br>Below is the purchase order workflow that has been followed until now:</p>

			<div class="row-full">
			<img class="widthfull width-web" src="../images/scm/img_po_flow.png">
			</div>
			<p class="text-center"><i>PI: Performa Invoice, PR: Purchase Request, PO: Purchase Order, SCM: Supply Chain Management</i></p>
			<div class="insertmargin24"></div>
			<p>The current system relied heavily upon email threads and third-party solutions like SAP and Easy ERP. This procedure has been pretty inefficient in terms of resources and man-hours that went into it. <br><br>After discussions with transformation, procurement, fulfillment, finance and PO team, we defined a standardized process that would be followed and would act as the base for defining the product as well.</p>

			<img class="widthfull width-web" src="../images/scm/img_proposed_po_flow.png">
			</div>
			<div class="insertmargin24"></div>
			<p>Defining the process helped us approach the problems in a linear fashion. The next step was setting the expectation and phasing the project.</p>

			<h3>Transformation (TR)</h3>
			<p>When transforming a property, certain audits are conducted to ensure the property matches the OYO standards. After the audits, a sheet is compiled through OYO Optimus app. This sheet populates a list of required elements and preferred specifications on TR dashboard.<br><br><i>Let's simplify this whole scenario:<br><br>John works in a grocery store and wants certain items like oranges, apples, packaging material and certain other material in stock. So, John places an order to a mediator "Robert" and occasionally keeps check on the order.<br>John doesn't care much how Robert fulfills the order but is concerned about when the order will be shipped.</i><br><br>Hence, there are three phases of TR:</p><br>
			<ol>
				<li>Conducting an audit (Done through Optimus app - refer to prototype below</li>
				<li>Placing an order</li>
				<li>Status of order</li>
			</ol>
			<div class="insertmargin24"></div>
			<p><b>Optimus App</b><br><br>The first step of trannsforming a property is conducting an audit on lead acquired for a fresh property. Since this requires a lot of moving around, we've built an app called Optimus that enables the  user to conduct audit (1st step) and fullfill orders (confirming items at property after procurement).<br><br>Take a look at the audit prototype:<br><br></p>

			<div class="insertmargin48"></div>
			<p><b>TR Web portal:</b><br><br>After conducting an audit, a comprehensive list of required items is built at backend, which the responsible person has to go through (also from TR team) and place the order. This user mostly sits at office and closely work with the onground TR staff.<br><br></p>

			<p><b>User Profiling</b><br><br>Three user groups can be tagged to properties</p>

			<h3>Supply Chain Management</h3><br>
			<p>Orders received from the TR team are allocated to members of the SCM team as per the employee mapping. SCM user has multiple responsibilities:</p><br>
			<ol>
				<li>Assign a vendor(s) that'll fulfill the order</li><br>
				<li>Upload PO (Purchase Order) for the item</li><br>
				<li>Ensure that all items are delivered</li><br>
				<li>Modify/Cancel the order</li><br>
				<li>Act as a point of contact for vendor and transformation team</li><br>
				<li>Assist vendor actions</li><br><br>
			</ol>
			<p>
				<i>Let's simply this scenario as well:<br>Robert receives an order from the grocery store with a list of multiple items. (Refer to transformation scenario above)<br><br>Robert assigns the order for oranges and apples to a vendor named "Fresh Beans" and packaging material to vendor "Lily Cardboards". Robert has already signed a contract with both vendors stating they'll deliver the products at a fixed price for a certain time frame. Robert gets the invoice and shipment information from the vendor and ensures the cargo reaches to John within the requested timeline.</i>

			<h3>What I learned</h3><br>
			<ol>
				<li>This project majorly taught me collaboration across various teams involved behind the scenes all leading towards one single goal.</li><br>
				<li>The complexity of data and process was a big challenge. Prioritizing the features helped develop a structure that brought consistency throughout.</li><br>
				<li>We actively tested our products with employees who'll be using it and their feedback was critical was defining the experience. e.g. There will be a lot of to and fro actions so we made sure to design where they won't have to jumble across pages.</li><br>
				<li>We heavily relied on the research received from all the teams and was a crucial part of decision making.</li><br>
				<li>Being humble: At the earlier stage, there were a lot of abbreviations and things I just couldn't grab at first go. I had to repetitively ask for clarity on almost each and everything. This made the further journey a lot easier.</li><br>

			<h3>Conclusion</h3>
			<p>We conducted the user acceptance testing earlier this year and the minimum viable product has already been rolled out for adoption. Below are expected numbers conveyed by the business team about the impact:</p>
