			<h1>Redesigning listing experience for OYO Rooms</h1>
			<div class="insertmargin24"></div>
			<p><b>About Company:</b><br>OYO is the world's fastest growing hotel company & 3rd largest chain of operated hotels, homes, managed living and work spaces.<br><br><b>My Role: Product Designer</b><br>I worked as an individual contributor along with Mr. Mukund Laddha (Sr. Product Manager, Consumer Web & App) and team of 20+ engineers. We started working on it in December 2018 and it went live in April 2019. This project also consisted the redesign of web home page.<br><br><b>Duration:</b><br>Dec'18 to March'19<br><br><i>Check final result here: www.oyorooms.com</i><br></p>
			<div class="insertmargin48"></div>
			<div class="text-center">
			<p class="text-grey">Disclaimer: The project was done during my tenure at OYO Rooms. To comply with my non-disclosure agreement, I have omitted and obfuscated confidential information in this case study. The information in this case study is my own and does not necessarily reflect the views of OYO Rooms/Oravel Stays Pvt Ltd.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="insertmargin48"></div>
			<p><b>Existing Listing Page:</b><br>The current design has catered to the audience since 2015 and this was going to be the first major redesign of listing page.</p>
			<div class="insertmargin24"></div>
			<img class="widthfull width-web" src="../images/listing/home-earlier.png">
			<div class="insertmargin24"></div>
			<h3>Problems:</h3><br>
			<ol>
				<li>Large potential for conversion improvement. </li><br>
				<li>Lack of information in property card which wasn't enabling customers to make decisions to narrow down their choices easily.</li><br>
				<li>The above problem lead to a lot of "To & fro Activity" between listing page and hotel detail page.</li><br>
				<li>Conveying value proposition of a property to the customer. </li><br>
				<li>Scanning through listing: The zig-zag pattern and similar images of each hotel (because of standard OYO brand guidelines) made it confusing for user to fixate on a single property. </li><br>
				<li>Align multiple teams internally to achieve common goal. There were around 20 stakeholders from various teams like listing, pricing, conversion, brand, marketing, SEO, search. As a part of this exercise, we had to align all teams with few give and takes. </li><br>
				<li>Improve the usability of filters, collections to help user make decisions easily. On business side, we wanted to create better funnels to track user behaviour.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<div class="insertmargin24"></div>
			<p><b>Key Metrics to measure impact for business:</b><br></p>
			<ol>
				<li>CTR (Click Through Rate) to detail page</li><br>
				<li>Conversion - Increase in URNs (Used Room Nights)</li><br>
				<li>Reduction in bounce rate</li>
			</ol>
			<div class="insertmargin48"></div>
			<h3>What our users want:</h3><br>
			<p>Before anything else, let's state how users were interacting with our website:</p><br>
			<ol>
				<li>50K-80K users visit oyorooms.com daily (in Dec'18).</li><br>
				<li>Of these users, around 70% are looking for accommodation in leisure or corporate cities.</li><br>
				<li>50% of bookings are made from first 5 listing of hotels. Following 5 listings drive around 30% of the bookings.</li><br>
				<li>60% of desktop users were using monitors with resolution of 1366 X 768, followed by 8% users on 1440 X 900, 7.5% on 1536 X 864 and 5% on 1600 X 900 and 1920 X 1080 each.</li>
			</ol>
			<div class="insertmargin24"></div>
			<p>After analysing feedback from call centres, hotels, online surveys, 1 on 1 with customers, product team observations, we compiled few pointers that matter to our users:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><b>Price:</b> Value for money and offers.</li><br>
				<li><b>Location:</b> Proximity to a location and accessibility.</li><br>
				<li><b>Visuals:</b> How the rooms look like, property reception and facade.</li><br>
				<li><b>Amenities:</b> Wifi, free breakfast, parking space, etc.</li><br>
				<li><b>Restrictions:</b> Foreigners, unmarried couples, smoking, etc.</li><br>
				<li><b>Security:</b> OYOs can be found in crowded streets, city outskirts, highways and customer wants to a sense of security in such spaces.</li><br>
			</ol>
			<p><i>Value we offer to customers: "Quality affordable stays"</i><br><br>OYO takes pride in converting mediocre living spaces and transforming them into quality spaces. This is clearly communicated through marketing campaigns and that's precisely what our user expects.</p>
			<div class="insertmargin48"></div>
			<h3>Building Stones:</h3><br>
			<ol>
				<li><b>Competitive analysis:</b> Studied online travel agents like booking.com, makemytrip, airbnb, priceline, agoda, etc. The biggest out-take from this was to go-ahead with the stacked list view to reduce the learning curve of the customers.</li><br>
				<li><b>Google analytics:</b> I worked with product team to understand the funnels and record user behaviour. We derived insights on how users land on our page, interact and when they make a decision or exit.</li><br>
				<li>Record <b>usage behaviour</b> through heat-maps.</li><br>
				<li>My colleague Mr. Siddharth Chowdhary (Team Lead for Consumer Design), helped me a lot to formulate a plan backed up by data and put it to use. We did a lot of <b>guerrilla testing</b> on existing designs and initial wireframes with employees internally to validate initial findings and decisions we were about to take.</li><br>
				<li><b>Wire-framing and explorations:</b> Over the course of the 2 month design sprint, we explored numerous grid styles, card layouts. These exercises went from paper, whiteboards to high fidelity mockups. For the sake of length of this article, I'll restrict myself to the final output.</li>

			</ol>
			<div class="insertmargin48"></div>
			<h3>Property Card:</h3><br>
			<ol>
				<li>Give all <b>critically decisive information</b> to user like property name, location, pricing, discount, call to action which helps user relate his/her basic needs and whether it checks out with the displayed information.</li><br>
				<li><b>Delight user with best images:</b> We gave quick access to top images , so that customer can easily consume what the property/rooms looks like. These images are displayed through a sequencing logic at back-end.</li><br>
				<li><b>Ratings:</b> We display the property rating based upon the check-out feedback from the users and prioritise the properties with better guest experience so the customer can get the best experience. Operationally, we ensure the properties maintain certain set of standards and if the ratings fall too low, correctional measures are taken.</li><br>
				<li><b>Amenities and Value Propositions:</b> With budget hotels, not all amenities are obvious e.g. there might be limited parking because the hotel is in crowded market and this has been one of common observation. Another example is not all hotels allowed unmarried couples in South Asia, and we want to explicitly call that such propositions out. Providing such gives the psychological advantage and nudges the user to proceed.</li><br>
				<li><b>Location:</b> When user selects a particular location, we want to assist user by showing the distance from that area. This is extremely helpful when user is looking for hotels near airport, railway stations or any tourist landmarks. When the user searches for a city instead, we just state out the area in which the property is located.</li>
			</ol>
			<p><br>Few focus areas while designing the visuals:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Showcase all decisive info</li><br>
				<li>Information hierarchy-using contrast, colour and font weight to highlight things</li><br>
				<li>Ease of scan-ability: present the info in F pattern (Link to study by Nielsen Norman Group: https://www.nngroup.com/articles/f-shaped-pattern-reading-web-content/)</li><br>
				<li>Utilise the space-edge to edge responsive design. Note: We shift to progressive web app below medium screen sizes.</li>

			<p><b>Other elements:</b></p><br>
			<ol>
				<li>Nudge to switch to map view</li><br>
				<li>Sign-up nudge: To incentivise user to make a first booking or register with us which increases the chances of a customer conversion.</li><br>
				<li>Discount information: Running offer which is already applied to covered hotels.</li><br>
				<li>Search bar<br><br>5. Sort capability: By popularity, guest rating, price high to low and price low to high.</li>
			</ol>
			<div class="insertmargin48"></div>
			<h3>Filters</h3><br>
			<ol>
				<li><b>Dynamic Filters:</b> In order to make filters useful, tech proposed dynamic positioning of filters according to the use-case of city. Each section within filters might change sequencing based upon city type. e.g. we priortise location and collections for leisure cities whereas for pit-stop cities price is more critical.</li><br>
				<li><b>Collections:</b> OYO groups properties based upon different criteria to assist user with the perfect stay. Few of them are: Based upon city type (leisure, corporate, pitstop, tier 2–3 cities), near beach, luxury stays (4 star/Premier stays),  group or couple travellers, short stays, etc.</li><br>
				<li><b>Popular locations:</b> We've integrated with Google api's to fetch most popular landmarks, locations which correspond to user search. These locations help user narrow down search results and provide better suggestions. This was already one of the most used filters and hence is generally prioritised for all use cases.</li><br>
				<li>Pricing, amenities, payment options</li><br>
				<li><b>Hotel categories:</b> OYO has sub-brands that appeal to different type of customers. e.g. Capital O hotels are meant for business stays and attract corporate users, townhouses are premier stays, etc. We listed down these categories with a small explanation.</li><br>
				<li><b>Wizard (Loyalty Program):</b> As of Dec'19, OYO's loyalty program has 6.1M users (incl. 4.4 million freemium users) and we incentivise the users with 5% additional discount. This section helps out filtering all loyalty discount applicable hotels.</li>

			<div class="insertmargin24"></div>
			<p>With excessive use of filters, non-serviceable areas, peak season we might run into no hotel available scenario. The communication is dealt as below:</p>

			<div class="insertmargin48"></div>
			<h3>Map View</h3><br>
			<p>The alternative to list view is exploring properties based upon location. This use-case is prominent for leisure cities. Decisions we took:</p><br>
			<ol>
				<li><b>Hotel pins:</b> price is the most sensitive info for user after the location as it acts as a stimulator to make a decision.</li><br>
				<li><b>Quick list view:</b> We incorporated a collapsed list view besides map for better scan-ability and upon a pin selection, expanded the collapsed card to make it easy for user to go through images. This drastically dropped the to and fro activity to the detail page.</li><br>
				<li><b>Cluster of properties:</b> Depending on the zoom level of the map, we clustered multiple properties into an individual pin. Upon clicking it, the automatically zooms into that area to show location pins of hotels.</li><br>
				<li><b>Filters:</b> The filters were designed to provide consistent experience as list view for the ease of use throughout the website.</li>

			<h3>UAT & Launch</h3><br>
			<p>We showcased the designs to multiple teams who were alienated to the designs till now and observed how they interacted with interface. After the user acceptance testing and implementing the critical tweaks, we went live with the collective redesign of homepage and listing page in March'19. We did an <b>A/B test with 20% audience</b> exposed to the new design, and the results were positive which eventually lead to rolling out the product to all customers globally.</p>
			<p>The unrequired to and fro activity to detail page dropped. We observed that the funnel from listing to detail page improved enhancing the conversion rate.<br><br><b><i>Conversion uplift: 1.4%  (April'19)<br>Bounce rate dropped by 3%</i></b><br><br>The other elements we ensured to improve business were city pages e.g. oyorooms.com/hotels-in-cityname, sub SEO pages, rate parity to make user book hotel on oyo website only.</p>
			<div class="insertmargin48"></div>
			<h3>What happened next: Internationalisation & Standardisation with App</h3><br>
			<p>During this phase, OYO expanded exponentially with operations in more than 800 cities and 80 countries world-wide. As OYO launched in new countries, we started to standardise design across all products. My colleague, Mr. Siddharth Chowdhary undertook the standardisation efforts and tweaked the designs based upon the feedback received to further improve the experience.<br><br>Take a look at the experience as of March'20:</p>

			<h3>What I learned from this project:</h3><br>
			<ol>
				<li><b>Stakeholder management:</b> With over 20 stakeholders involved from business, tech and product,  I had to ensure the requirements from each vertical are being met without hindering the user experience.</li><br>
				<li><b>Design Communication:</b> I had to pro-actively communicate my decisions and convince the stakeholder. We actively engaged in discussions and filtered out the right feedback. </li><br>
				<li><b>Backing-up decisions with data:</b> When business is at stake, you can't go with what you believe might work out. We ventured deep into analysis to take decisive actions. When the data wasn't available, we relied on collective feedback of customers.</li>
